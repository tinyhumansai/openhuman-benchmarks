# Turn the memory engine off. `has_api_key` tests only that a key is *present*
# (`key.is_some()`), so the dummy credential below makes the hosted TinyHumans
# engine look usable and `tools::ops` registers the `memory` tool -- a tool that
# can only fail here. When the model reaches for it the 401 is a tool failure of
# class `authentication`, and ONE of those aborts the whole turn:
# terminal-bench 4.0 `payments-pipeline-fix` stopped on
# "failure class `authentication` still blocks operation `memory`" with 22h of
# its budget unused, having spent only 27 calls. It is latent in every run --
# all five runs inspected were offered the tool -- and fires whenever the model
# happens to pick it, so it is a variance source across the whole suite.
#
# An empty engine id is the supported off switch (memory/engine.rs `resolve`:
# `"" => off(..., "no memory engine selected")`), and there is no env override
# for it, so it goes in the config the workspace resolves to. Memory should be
# off here regardless: every peer harness is stateless, each task gets a fresh
# container, and the lifecycle hooks would recall against an empty engine
# anyway. The hooks themselves are fail-soft (pre_turn/post_turn/compaction all
# swallow the error and let the turn run), so only the model-issued tool is
# dangerous.
# Web search is off: the bench configures no search provider, so every
# `web_search_tool` call came back `provider returned HTTP 401`. The model
# reached for it in 4 of the first 38 Terminal-Bench 2.0 tasks and, until the
# breaker learned to steer off a refused connector, each of those turns ended
# there (build-pov-ray after 69 s of a 3 h 20 m budget). A tool that cannot
# work is not part of the agent being measured; the task containers keep
# their internet, so `shell` can still fetch what a task needs.
