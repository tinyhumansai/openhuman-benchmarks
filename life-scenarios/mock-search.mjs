/**
 * A mock TinyHumans backend for the life-scenario benchmark, serving the one
 * route the agent's `web_search_tool` needs.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `web_search_tool` is not a local tool: it posts to
 * `/agent-integrations/parallel/search` on the hosted backend, which resolves
 * the query against a paid search provider and bills the caller's team. The
 * benchmark has no session to spend — it runs BYOK inference on an offline
 * local token — so every call came back
 * `SESSION_EXPIRED: backend rejected session token … (401 Invalid token)`.
 *
 * The tool was advertised anyway (`tool spec filter: … web_search_tool`), so
 * the model spent calls discovering that it was dead and then routed around it
 * by hand: in the 2026-09-23 run `baggage-policy` burned two calls on the 401s
 * and then improvised a DuckDuckGo HTML scrape, guessing delta.com paths and
 * collecting four 404s. It reached the 15-call cap with the answer assembled
 * and the requested file unwritten, and graded 0/1.
 *
 * That is a defect in the benchmark rig, not in the product: the run offers a
 * capability its own configuration cannot serve. Removing the tool instead
 * would have been the other kind of dishonest — `baggage-policy` and
 * `fact-check-publish` are *about* finding things on the web.
 *
 * ## What is mocked, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * **Discovery is mocked. Retrieval is not.** This server ranks a fixture
 * corpus (`fixtures/search-index.json`) and returns real, live URLs. The agent
 * still fetches each page over the network with `web_fetch` and still has to
 * read what the page actually says. So `baggage-policy`'s `cites_delta_com`
 * and `states_carryon_dimensions` checks stay honest — what is gone is the
 * search engine the run cannot pay for, not the comprehension being measured.
 *
 * Ranking is deliberately crude (term overlap over title, URL, keywords and
 * excerpt). A cleverer ranker would start deciding the scenario's outcome,
 * which is the grader's job.
 *
 * ## Why it takes over the whole backend base URL
 *
 * `api_url` is the single base every backend caller resolves through
 * (`api::config::effective_backend_api_url`), so pointing it here is what
 * routes the search. That also catches the other backend calls the run makes
 * and cannot authenticate — `/teams/me/usage`, the Composio toolkit list —
 * which previously logged a 401 per turn. They are answered with benign empty
 * stubs, so the log shows the run's own behaviour rather than a fixed auth
 * failure repeated once a turn. Composio itself is untouched: it is redirected
 * separately to `mock-composio.mjs` by `OPENHUMAN_COMPOSIO_DIRECT_BASE_V*`.
 *
 * Loopback with an ephemeral port is important. `effective_backend_api_url`
 * ignores an `api_url` that looks like an inference endpoint, and
 * `looks_like_local_ai_endpoint` treats loopback as a signal only when it is
 * paired with an LLM-ish port or path — so a bare `http://127.0.0.1:<random>`
 * is passed through as a backend override, which is exactly what this needs.
 *
 * Every unhandled route is recorded and answered 404, so a future capability
 * that starts reaching for the backend shows up in `search-requests.json`
 * rather than failing silently.
